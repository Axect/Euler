# Axect's Euler Archive

This repo contains my solutions for [Euler Problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives). My primary language is Haskell and also use Rust, Julia, Python. If you have a question, then plz email to me.

If you want to benchmark, then type next command

```sh
./bench.sh [problem]
```

This benchmark use [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).

For example, if you want to measure average time (10 times) of problem 1, then

```sh
./bench.sh 1
```

And go to `Bench/euler001.md`
